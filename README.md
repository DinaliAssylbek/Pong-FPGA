# Pong Game for DE1-SoC
This repository contains the implementation of a Pong game designed for the DE1-SoC FPGA board. It was developed as part of the CS 3710 course at the University of Utah. The project showcases a hardware-based approach to game development, integrating CPU, RAM, and VGA display components.

### Project Overview
The Pong game relies on three key components:
##### 1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Executes CR-16 assembly code to manage game logic.
- Organized into three loops corresponding to the game states: intro, game, and game over.
- Calculates and updates paddle positions, ball position, game state, and scores.
##### 2. Memory
- Stores game data, including paddle/ball positions, scores, and game state.
- Implements a Verilog-based wrapper module for memory-mapped I/O functionality.
- Special memory addresses interact with controllers for player input.
##### 3. VGA Display
- Continuously reads specific memory locations to render the game.
- Updates the display to show paddle and ball positions, scores, and game states.

### Repository Structure
VGA Submodule: Contains the VGA display logic responsible for rendering the game visuals based on memory data.

CPU Submodule: Includes the CPU implementation that executes the assembly code and handles game logic.

Assembler Folder:Holds the Python-based assembler for CR-16 assembly code and the assembly code for the game.

### Memory Organization
The memory is divided into the following sections:

### SEGA Genesis Controller Integration
The game uses two SEGA Genesis controllers for input. The controllers are connected to the FPGAâ€™s GPIO pins. The memory wrapper maps controller input to specific memory addresses, allowing the CPU to "read" inputs during each game loop.

### How It Works
- CPU: Reads inputs from the controllers and updates game elements in memory.
- Memory: Acts as an intermediary between the CPU and VGA. Includes special functionality for memory-mapped I/O.
- VGA: Continuously refreshes the screen based on memory data.
- Controllers: Provide real-time input for gameplay through memory-mapped addresses.

This structure enables smooth gameplay and efficient data management, recreating the classic Pong game on hardware.
